🚨 CRITICAL RULE: Every action MUST be repeatable EVERY SINGLE DAY without exception.

For each domain provided, generate 10 SIMPLE daily action options that support the quarterly target.

Each action MUST:
- Be doable literally EVERY day (365 days per year, including weekends, holidays, sick days)
- Take 5-30 minutes maximum
- Be specific and concrete (not vague goals)
- Start with an action verb (Read, Write, Practice, Do, Walk, Call, Journal, etc.)
- Be sustainable to repeat daily indefinitely
- Describe a repeatable personal behavior, not an appointment, not a scheduled event, and not something that depends on a calendar
- Be something the person can initiate on their own, even if others may or may not participate
- Explicitly include an approximate time (for example: "for 10 minutes", "for 20 minutes", "for about 5 minutes")
- Be SUPPORTING ACTIONS that build toward the target, NOT the target itself (Think: "What small daily behavior helps me achieve my bigger goal?" not "Do my bigger goal daily")

Must NOT contain these words or phrases:
"daily", "every day", "each day", "per day", "weekly", "once a week", "every Sunday", "Sundays", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "monthly", "once a month", "quarterly", "event", "meeting", "service project", "game night", "outing", "gathering", "every weekend", "bi-weekly", "semi-monthly", "appointment", "session", "class", "workshop", "conference", "scheduled", "attend", "join", "participate in"

Do not generate actions that:
- Require a specific day of the week
- Require a specific time of the month
- Depend on external events being scheduled (meetings, services, events, trips, gatherings)
- Require other people to be present or agree to participate

INVALID EXAMPLES (DO NOT GENERATE):
❌ "Attend youth group meetings once a week" (weekly, not daily + contains "meeting")
❌ "Plan a family outing monthly" (monthly, not daily + contains "outing")
❌ "Schedule one-on-one time weekly" (weekly, not daily + contains "scheduled")
❌ "Organize an event" (one-time, not repeatable + contains "event")
❌ "Go to church every Sunday" (weekly, not daily + contains "Sunday")
❌ "Attend a short daily team huddle" (contains "attend" + "meeting" concept)
❌ "Host family game night" (scheduled event + contains "game night")
❌ "Join a weekly accountability call" (weekly + contains "join")
❌ "Participate in team standup" (contains "participate in" + scheduled)
❌ "Take a yoga class on Tuesdays" (specific day + contains "class")
❌ "Schedule a coaching session" (contains "session" + "scheduled")
❌ "Attend networking events" (contains "attend" + "events")
❌ "Go to gym on weekdays" (specific days, not truly daily)

VALID EXAMPLES (GENERATE LIKE THESE):
✅ "Read a devotional for 10 minutes every morning"
✅ "Journal about gratitude for 5 minutes before bed"
✅ "Practice 10 minutes of mindfulness meditation"
✅ "Text or call one friend or family member to check in for 5 minutes"
✅ "Do 20 push-ups and 20 squats"
✅ "Walk for 15 minutes after dinner"
✅ "Read one chapter of a book for 15 minutes"
✅ "Write down 3 things you're grateful for (5 minutes)"
✅ "Pray or reflect for 10 minutes in the morning"
✅ "Practice a new skill for 20 minutes"

KEY PRINCIPLE - SUPPORTING ACTIONS vs LITERAL TARGETS:
❌ Target: "Spend 30 min with kids weekly" → Don't suggest: "Spend 30 min with kids daily"
✅ Target: "Spend 30 min with kids weekly" → Do suggest: "Ask one child about their day for 10 minutes"

❌ Target: "Exercise 3x/week" → Don't suggest: "Exercise for 30 minutes daily"
✅ Target: "Exercise 3x/week" → Do suggest: "Do 10 squats and stretches for 5 minutes"

❌ Target: "Read 2 books this quarter" → Don't suggest: "Read a book for 1 hour daily"
✅ Target: "Read 2 books this quarter" → Do suggest: "Read for 15 minutes before bed"

VALIDATION CHECK:
Before including an action, ask yourself: "Can someone literally do this 365 days per year, including weekends, holidays, sick days, and days when their schedule changes unexpectedly?"
If the answer is NO, do not include it.

HABITS vs EVENTS:
✅ HABITS = Repeatable personal behaviors (reading, writing, exercising, praying, journaling, practicing)
❌ EVENTS = Scheduled activities that happen at specific times (meetings, services, gatherings, outings, nights, projects)

FINAL SELF-CHECK PROCESS:
Before finalizing the list:
1. Scan your actions and remove any that are not clearly daily habits
2. Remove any that include forbidden words ("weekly", "monthly", "Sunday", "meeting", "event", "outing", "gathering", etc.)
3. Verify every action includes an approximate time duration (5-30 minutes)
4. Verify every action can be done alone without requiring others
5. Replace any removed actions with new actions that meet all rules

Return ONLY valid JSON with no markdown formatting. Each action should be a simple string (no objects, no metadata).`;

    // Build the input list for the prompt

Return JSON in this EXACT format - just arrays of simple strings:
{
  "body": [
    "Walk for 20 minutes after dinner",
    "Do 20 push-ups in the morning for 5 minutes",
    "Drink 8 glasses of water throughout the day",
    "Stretch for 10 minutes before bed",
    "Take the stairs for 5 minutes",
    "Hold a plank for 5 minutes",
    "Practice yoga poses for 15 minutes",
    "Track protein intake for 5 minutes",
    "Meditate for 5 minutes after waking",
    "Journal about physical sensations for 5 minutes"
  ],
  "being": [...10 actions...],
  "balance": [...10 actions...],
  "business": [...10 actions...]
}

IMPORTANT:
🚨 DAILY FREQUENCY REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
- Return EXACTLY 10 actions per domain
- Each action should be a simple string (no objects)
- Make actions diverse and varied
- Only include domains that were provided in the input
- EVERY action must be doable EVERY SINGLE DAY (no weekly/monthly/event-based suggestions)
- Every action must mention an approximate duration between 5 and 30 minutes
- If you're unsure if something is daily, ask yourself: "Can someone literally do this 365 days per year?" If no, don't include it

NO PATTERNS ALLOWED:
- NO weekly activities (no "once a week", "every Sunday", "weekly")
- NO monthly activities (no "once a month", "monthly")
- NO scheduled events (no "meeting", "service", "gathering", "outing", "event", "game night")
- NO calendar-dependent actions (no "Sundays", "weekends", "first Monday")
- NO actions requiring specific external schedules

365-DAY TEST: Every action must pass this test: "Can I do this today, tomorrow, next Tuesday, on Christmas, when I'm traveling, when I'm sick, on weekends, and on my birthday?" If NO to any, reject it.

FOCUS: Generate HABITS (daily personal behaviors) not EVENTS (scheduled activities).

DURATION REQUIREMENT: Every action must include an explicit time phrase like "for 10 minutes", "for 5 minutes", "for 20 minutes".

EVENT REJECTION RULE: If any suggestion even slightly resembles a scheduled event (service, meeting, group, outing, night, project), discard it and replace it with a solo, repeatable daily behavior.`;
